READ ME:

Most of the group's development agents are included in the players folder.
The agents are composed of 4 series:

01: naive rule-based agents similar to the naive_Player.
02: BFS approach
03: Minimax agents
04: MCTS agents

We selectively include the most important ones in the report and briefly 
explained the development iteration steps for each technique series.
